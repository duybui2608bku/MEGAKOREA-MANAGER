# Progress: MEGA-HOLDING-MANAGER

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### Core Authentication System

- **User Registration**: Complete with validation
  - Name, phone, password, gender collection
  - Default role and status assignment
  - Password hashing and security
- **User Login**: JWT-based authentication
  - Token generation and validation
  - Secure session management
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions working
  - Admin vs User role differentiation
  - Protected route middleware

### Profile Management

- **Profile Retrieval**: Users can view their profiles
- **Profile Updates**: Users can modify their information
- **Password Changes**: Secure password update functionality
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization working

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Database Connection**: MongoDB connection with environment configs
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error processing
- **Middleware Chain**: Security, logging, and validation middlewares
- **TypeScript Setup**: Full type safety with path aliases
- **Development Environment**: Hot reload and build process working

### Architecture Implementation

- **Clean Architecture**: Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Repositories ‚Üí Models
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has clear responsibilities
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based settings
- **Code Organization**: Logical folder structure and naming conventions

## What's Left to Build üöß

### High Priority Features

#### 1. Department Management System

- **Department CRUD Operations**
  - Create new departments
  - List all departments
  - Update department information
  - Delete departments (with user reassignment)
- **Admin Department Management**
  - Admin-only access to department operations
  - Department assignment to users
  - Department hierarchy (if needed)

#### 2. Admin User Management

- **User Administration**
  - List all users (admin only)
  - View user details
  - Modify user roles
  - Change user status (activate/deactivate/ban)
- **User Assignment**
  - Assign users to departments
  - Modify user titles and positions
  - Bulk user operations

#### 3. Enhanced Authentication

- **Refresh Token System**
  - Long-lived refresh tokens
  - Token renewal mechanism
  - Secure token storage
- **Session Management**
  - Token expiration handling
  - Logout functionality
  - Session invalidation

### Medium Priority Features

#### 4. API Enhancements

- **Input Validation**
  - More comprehensive validation rules
  - Better error messages
  - Request sanitization improvements
- **Response Standardization**
  - Consistent API response format
  - Proper HTTP status codes
  - Error code standardization

#### 5. Security Improvements

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Authentication endpoint protection
  - API abuse prevention
- **Additional Security Headers**
  - CORS configuration
  - Additional helmet settings
- **Audit Logging**
  - User action tracking
  - Security event logging

### Low Priority Features

#### 6. Documentation & Testing

- **API Documentation**
  - Swagger/OpenAPI specification
  - Endpoint documentation
  - Authentication flow documentation
- **Testing Suite**
  - Unit tests for services
  - Integration tests for APIs
  - Test data management

#### 7. Performance & Monitoring

- **Database Optimization**
  - Query optimization
  - Additional indexing
  - Connection pooling tuning
- **Monitoring**
  - Health check endpoints
  - Performance metrics
  - Error tracking

## Current Status Summary

### Completion Percentage

- **Core Features**: ~70% complete
- **Admin Features**: ~20% complete
- **Security Features**: ~60% complete
- **Documentation**: ~90% complete (thanks to memory bank)
- **Testing**: ~0% complete

### Technical Debt

- **Low**: Clean architecture and good patterns established
- **Areas to Watch**:
  - Error handling could be more comprehensive
  - Input validation could be more robust
  - Need to add refresh token system

### Performance Status

- **Current**: Suitable for development and small-scale deployment
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports scaling
- **Bottlenecks**: None identified at current scale

## Known Issues üêõ

### Minor Issues

1. **Department Assignment**: Users can be assigned departments but no department management exists
2. **Admin Functionality**: Limited admin-specific operations
3. **Token Expiration**: No refresh token mechanism
4. **Error Messages**: Could be more user-friendly

### No Critical Issues

- No blocking bugs identified
- System is stable and functional
- All core user flows work as expected

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Focus

1. **Department Management**: Implement full CRUD operations
2. **Admin User Management**: Add user listing and management endpoints
3. **Enhanced Validation**: Improve input validation and error handling

### Success Criteria for Next Phase

- Admins can create and manage departments
- Admins can list and manage all users
- Users can be properly assigned to departments
- Enhanced error handling and validation

## Development Notes
