# Active Context: MEGA-HOLDING-MANAGER

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Foundation Complete

The project has a solid foundational structure with core user management functionality implemented. The system is ready for enhancement and expansion.

### Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Complete documentation structure established
- **Architecture Analysis**: Clean architecture pattern confirmed and documented
- **Core Features**: User authentication and profile management are functional
- **Entry Point Configuration**: Updated package.json to ensure src/index.ts runs first on app startup
- **Refresh Token Implementation**: Complete refresh token system implemented following clean architecture patterns

## Current System State

### What's Working

✅ **User Registration & Authentication**

- User registration with comprehensive profile data
- JWT-based login system
- Password hashing and security
- Refresh token system for secure token renewal

✅ **Profile Management**

- User profile retrieval
- Profile updates
- Password change functionality

✅ **Architecture Foundation**

- Clean separation of concerns (Controllers → Services → Repositories → Models)
- Middleware chain for security and validation
- Environment-based configuration
- Error handling infrastructure

✅ **Database Design**

- User and Department models defined
- Proper relationships and indexing
- Enum-based status and role management

### Areas for Enhancement

#### 1. Department Management (High Priority)

- **Missing**: Department CRUD operations
- **Need**: Admin interface for department management
- **Impact**: Users can be assigned to departments but departments can't be managed

#### 2. Admin Functionality (High Priority)

- **Missing**: Admin-specific endpoints for user management
- **Need**: User listing, status management, role assignment
- **Impact**: No administrative oversight capabilities

#### 3. Data Validation & Error Handling (Medium Priority)

- **Enhancement**: More comprehensive validation rules
- **Need**: Better error messages and handling
- **Impact**: Improved user experience and security

#### 4. Security Enhancements (Medium Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

- **✅ COMPLETED**: Refresh token implementation
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Token expiration and renewal
- **Impact**: Better security and user experience achieved

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. **Department Management System**

   - Create department CRUD operations
   - Add admin-only department management endpoints
   - Implement department listing and assignment

2. **Admin User Management**
   - Add user listing endpoint (admin only)
   - Implement user status management (activate/deactivate/ban)
   - Add user role assignment functionality

### Short-term Goals (1-2 Sessions)

3. **✅ Enhanced Authentication - COMPLETED**

   - ✅ Implement refresh token system
   - ✅ Add token expiration handling
   - ✅ Improve session management

4. **Validation & Error Improvements**
   - Enhance input validation rules
   - Improve error message clarity
   - Add comprehensive request sanitization

### Medium-term Goals (3-5 Sessions)

5. **API Documentation**

   - Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - Create API usage examples
   - Document authentication flows

6. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for services and repositories
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Test data management

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **Confirmed**: Clean architecture pattern is working well
- **Confirmed**: JWT authentication approach is appropriate
- **Confirmed**: MongoDB with Mongoose is suitable for the data model

### Technical Considerations

- **Database**: Consider adding indexes for performance as data grows
- **Security**: Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- **Scalability**: Current structure supports horizontal scaling

### Business Logic Considerations

- **User Roles**: Current Admin/User roles may need expansion
- **Department Hierarchy**: Consider if departments need parent-child relationships
- **User Status**: Current status system (Active/Inactive/Banned) covers basic needs

## Development Environment

### Current Setup

- **Development**: Hot reload with nodemon working
- **Build**: TypeScript compilation with path aliases
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier configured
- **Database**: MongoDB connection with environment-based configuration

### Ready for Development

- All development tools are configured and working
- Clean codebase with consistent patterns
- Clear separation of concerns makes adding features straightforward
- Comprehensive error handling infrastructure in place

## Communication Notes

### For Next Developer Session

- Memory bank is fully initialized and comprehensive
- Project structure is well-documented and follows clean architecture
- Core user management is complete and tested
- Priority should be on department management and admin functionality
- All patterns and conventions are established and documented
