# Product Context: MEGA-HOLDING-MANAGER

## Why This Project Exists

### Business Problem

Large holding companies face significant challenges in managing their diverse workforce across multiple departments and subsidiaries. Traditional HR systems often lack the flexibility and scalability needed to handle complex organizational structures with varying roles, titles, and departmental hierarchies.

### Key Pain Points Addressed

1. **Fragmented User Management**: Employees scattered across different systems without centralized management
2. **Complex Role Management**: Need for flexible role-based access control across different organizational levels
3. **Department Organization**: Difficulty in organizing and tracking employees across various departments
4. **Security Concerns**: Need for robust authentication and authorization in corporate environments
5. **Profile Management**: Employees need self-service capabilities to manage their profiles while maintaining administrative oversight

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

- **Department Visibility**: Clear understanding of their department assignment and role

#### For Administrators

- **User Oversight**: Complete visibility and control over user accounts
- **Role Management**: Ability to assign and modify user roles and permissions
- **Department Management**: Organize users into appropriate departments

### Core User Flows

3. Modify user roles and permissions
4. Manage user account status

## Success Metrics
